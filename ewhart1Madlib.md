	In the meadows surrounding London, in the late 1800s, there lay a young __dish__ named __Harold__ contemplating a scene that
 was playing out in front of the tree he sat upon. The spectacle he beheld was a(n) __colorful__ woman under scrutiny for something that he could 
not quite make out. Recognizing the woman as his childhood nanny, young __Santa__ sprang to his feet and approached the scene
 __swimmingly__. He knew not yet what he would say in defense of his previous caretaker, for he did not know whether she was guilty or not,
 however he felt a stong urge welling up in his throat, ready to burst from his vocal chords.
	 "_Howdy_!" he yelled to the __rowdy__ group of men surrounding his old friend. Puzzled, they turned to face young __Santa__ with his chest out, standing more confidently than a __peacock__. An eruption of __lava__ came from the men as they
observed our young hero, standing up for his old friend. Then an old voice came from amongst the men and silence fell over them. 
	"__Santa__" the woman said. "I am guilty. I am guilty of __arson__. One day I was in the town and I felt the urge to __eat
purjury__. Now as you know this is punishable by __detention__. However, if you will testify on my behalf, I may be relieved of this
 charge. What say you?"
	Following a moment of contemplation, __Sam__ simply replied, "__The ball is in your court__."
